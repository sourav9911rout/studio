This simplifies data retrieval and updates. \n\n**Authorization Independence:** Since no user-specific data or complex access control is mentioned, and a simple PIN-based edit mode is used, denormalization isn't strictly necessary at this level.  If more granular user-based access controls are added in the future, a separate collection to store authorized editor UIDs (or a similar mechanism) can be introduced.\n\n**QAPs:**  This structure inherently supports simple `list` operations since all documents share the same security posture (date-based entries).\n"
